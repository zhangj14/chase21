# NC Chase

Don't worry about the LinkedList class and Person class in admin.py.
They were created to store user information, but it's not very efficient.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the root directory in code editor.
3. In the terminal (cmd/powershell) type "python -m venv venv".
4. A folder called "venv" should be created parallel to the "app" folder.
5. In the terminal type "venv\Scripts\activate".
6. Now you should be in a virtual environment indicated by "(venv)" at the beginning of a line.
7. Install following packages "flask", "mysql-connector-python".
8. In the terminal type "set flask_app=app", "set flask_env=development","flask run".
9. Now ctrl+click the link.
10. Please create a new branch for any changes.

Config.py:
mysql {
    'username': 'root',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'nc_chase_3',
    'password': 'YourPassword',
}
